#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Static watcher program for a validated PR/MR poll sidecar.
# It reports what actually moved on a pull request and stays silent otherwise,
# including on every error, so a failed lookup can never be read as movement.
# The provider-tagged identity is data in the sidecar and is never interpolated
# into this source: these bytes are identical for every task.
# Each provider is read through its own standard CLI, gh for GitHub and glab
# for GitLab, so an upstream checkout needs no extra tooling to follow either.
#
# Two output shapes, and the difference is load-bearing:
#   merged        - the exact terminal token, unchanged, which the watcher
#                   routes through merge-outcome publication and poll retirement.
#   moved <state> - the pull request's current observable state, printed for
#                   every non-merged reading. It is a FINGERPRINT, not an event:
#                   this program is a pure function of the pull request and
#                   keeps no memory between runs, so an unchanged reading prints
#                   the same line every poll. Deciding what changed, and waking
#                   only then, belongs to the caller holding the previous
#                   reading (bin/fm-pr-lib.sh's observed-state marker).
#
# Only the GitHub branch reports movement. Reading GitLab's fields would need
# either a JSON processor firstmate does not require or an unverified reading of
# glab's rendered layout, so a GitLab merge request still reports its merge
# alone - and fm_pr_poll_covers_wait refuses to silence a timed recheck for one.
