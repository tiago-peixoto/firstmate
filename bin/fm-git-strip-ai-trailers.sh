# Strip AI co-author and generated-with trailers from a commit message, and
# install that strip as a per-task git commit-msg hook for a fleet launch.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-git-strip-ai-trailers.sh <msgfile>
#       Commit-msg hook mode. Git passes the proposed message file as $1.
#       Rewrites that file in place, then exits 0 so the commit proceeds.
#   fm-git-strip-ai-trailers.sh install <hooks-dir> <worktree>
#       Recreate <hooks-dir> as a core.hooksPath for this launch: a commit-msg
#       hook that runs this strip, plus one wrapper per client-side hook name
#       git documents. Each wrapper unsets GIT_CONFIG_* and then resolves
#       core.hooksPath (or $GIT_DIR/hooks) in the repository git is actually
#       running in, so a husky directory that only appears after npm install
#       still runs, and git -C some-other-repo does not inherit the task
#       worktree's hooks. Does not touch the project's git config; the caller
#       prefixes the pane with GIT_CONFIG_COUNT / GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0 /
#       GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Claude launches already carry attribution-off in their
# per-launch --settings JSON. Cursor and other non-Claude runtimes inject a
# Co-Authored-By trailer at the tooling layer AFTER the worker types a clean
# message, so the typed message is not the commit object.
# A prior per-machine ~/.cursor/cli-config.json attribution-off is not durable:
# it does not travel with Firstmate, it defaults back to on when unset, and it
# only feeds the CLI's request to the server - the trailer text is emitted by
# the model, so the setting suppresses rather than prevents it. Verified live
# on cursor-agent 2026.09.15 with attribution on: the trailer is already in
# .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG when the commit-msg hook runs, so the spawn-owned hook is
# the layer that sees the assembled message before the commit object is written.
# Human Co-Authored-By trailers are left untouched. Author identity is not
# rewritten.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, ruled 2026-09-17. git commit --no-verify skips every hook,
# so a worker that passes it still lands the trailer, as would a runtime that
# writes the commit object without running git. Both incidents that motivated
# this strip came through an ordinary hook-running commit, so the ruling is to
# accept that gap rather than add a push-side rewrite or a push-side check. A
# trailer found on a fleet commit therefore points at one of those two paths,
# not at an unnoticed hole in the matcher.
