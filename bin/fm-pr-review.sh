# `arm` installs one source in this home's existing process-event runner. Every
# captured result classifies terminal, so the runner retires that registration
# and coverage resumes only when the adjudication owner re-arms after handling
# the result or the next locked session-start bootstrap re-arms it. Bootstrap
# calls `arm` automatically for the main Firstmate home, so no cron job,
# LaunchAgent, daemon, custom watcher check, token, or separate credential is
# needed. The source uses gh-axi and its authenticated GitHub identity, sleeps
# until its durable slow-poll deadline, and remains silent when the relevant PR
# set, exact heads, feedback identities, and queue actionability are unchanged.
# An unchanged poll makes no model call and starts no worker. A pull request
# whose live detail read answers closed is omitted; a read, pagination, or
# schema failure for one open pull request keeps that pull request's last
# covered head and feedback cursor, records the failure in the snapshot,
# announces one deduplicated diagnostic, and lets the rest of the inventory
# reconcile. Authentication, rate, and total-deadline failures still fail the
# whole poll without publishing a partial inventory.
#
# `opt-out` is the explicit durable captain-takeover control for one canonical
# pull request. It parks nonterminal work while preserving the last covered head
# and feedback cursor. `opt-in` removes that one record, reopens parked work, and
# makes the next poll due immediately, so every intervening exact head and
# feedback identity is compared against the last covered cursor rather than
# silently becoming the new baseline.
#
# Queue and response mechanics are private under state/pr-review/. The Node state
# owner binds every item to repository, PR number, exact head, feedback node,
# parent thread, generation, verdict, response state, owning task, and retry
# count. Claims serialize the standing one-at-a-time review lane. A truncated
# feedback prefix is completed by `fetch-feedback` through bounded authenticated
# chunks and stored privately before adjudication. Completion and response
# delivery re-read the exact GitHub head. A moved head requeues the same
# item at a new generation. A live read that finds the pull request closed or
# merged ends the item with the terminal outcome pull-closed-without-response and
# exit 7 at every completion boundary, discards any pending public response,
# releases the lane, and never posts after closure; a response GitHub already
# accepted is still reconciled instead. Observing that pull request open again
# resumes exactly those closed items at a new generation, whether or not the
# covered head moved and whether or not the item's head was requeued away from
# the head it was created at, and leaves every other terminal outcome and the
# live review owner alone. A failed reply keeps one already-bound response
# for retry instead of rerunning a correction. Delivery first searches the
# original thread for the response's self-authored exact-body binding marker, so
# a crash after GitHub accepted the response is reconciled without knowingly
# posting it twice. Immediately before any formal COMMENT review or legacy
# fallback-comment write, delivery re-reads the live PR author and authenticated
# actor. Equality returns exit 6, discards the outward response, and preserves a
# private implementation-owner route; no fallback-comment write is supported.
#
# Fixed feedback requires a private validation JSON file with schema
# fm-pr-review-validation.v1, owner_task matching the claim, the exact head,
# result checks-green or selected-lifecycle-passed, and a focused proof string.
# The only terminal feedback outcomes are fixed-and-replied,
# dismissed-and-replied, duplicate-and-replied, superseded-and-replied,
# captain-decision-pending, and pull-closed-without-response. A captain decision
# stages no outward response.
# An authored initial review records clean privately or stages supported findings
# with `complete-review --outcome findings` for its owning implementation task;
# after correction, `findings-corrected` completes that same private review. It
# never counts as independent evidence and never stages a reply. A foreign PR can
# post only a COMMENT review after the live identity guard. No command in this
# interface approves or merges a pull request.
