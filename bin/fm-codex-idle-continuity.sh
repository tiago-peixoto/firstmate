# Codex Stop-owned idle continuity for process-event reconciliation.
#
# Codex Stop hooks are synchronous and asynchronous command hooks are not
# available (codex-cli 0.154.0, developers.openai.com/codex/hooks). Holding
# the watcher inside the hook would keep the turn in progress. This script
# therefore starts one detached supervisor only on the allowing stop
# (stop_hook_active true), after the one forced continuation, and then
# forwards the original payload to bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh.
#
# The supervisor is not a shell job of the hook. It is detached with a perl
# fork-and-setsid, because util-linux setsid is absent on macOS, so the hook
# returns as soon as the new session exists. The supervisor backgrounds one
# bin/fm-watch-arm.sh at a time and waits on it, so it can stop the arm when
# the recorded Codex process exits. While that process lives, each
# actionable arm close is queued back into the same thread with
# `codex queue`. FM_CODEX_IDLE_QUEUE, when set, receives that text on stdin
# instead. FM_CODEX_IDLE_OWNER_PID overrides the Codex ancestor walk.
#
# Away mode is checked again whenever an arm closes and before the next one
# starts: an away-mode close is not queued and the watcher is not stopped,
# because the away daemon owns triage from then on.
#
# A home that opted into config/supervision-host is not covered yet
# (https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/issues/5899): it never starts a
# supervisor, and its in-turn checkpoint is unchanged.
#
# Only the session that owns state/.lock, as bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh
# decides it, starts or repairs a supervisor; a dead recorded owner is
# reclaimed through bin/fm-lock.sh first, as bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh
# does. A supervisor counts as live only while its recorded pid is alive and
# still has the recorded pid identity; `--live` reports that verdict. An idle home, away mode, a child worktree, or a stop that is still the
# first one in the turn does not start a supervisor. A live supervisor is
# left in place, and an allowing stop from another thread of the same owner
# only replaces its recorded thread id. This script never prints on the spawn path: the guard's
# stdout and stderr are the hook output.
#
# The supervisor owns only the idle gap. bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh runs
# `--handover` before it starts a watcher, and only when this process's
# session owns state/.lock: that stops this home's supervisor, matched by its
# recorded pid identity, and waits for the watcher lock to be free, so the
# turn's checkpoint owns supervision until the next allowing stop starts a
# fresh supervisor. A checkpoint from any other session leaves the owner's
# supervisor running. The lock directory is written before the detached
# supervisor exists, with the hook pid in `starting`, and neither a second
# stop nor a handover treats that directory as stale until `pid` is recorded
# or the hook pid is dead. An arm cycle that ends because another owner took
# or ended the watcher is a handover, not a failure. A later
# `attached watcher ... stalled` line is a failure even when an earlier line
# said `watcher: attached`.
#
# When the recorded Codex owner exits, the supervisor stops a watcher only
# when this supervisor's own arm printed `watcher: started`. An arm that only
# attached is following a watcher someone else started, and a home-wide
# `--stop` would take that watcher down with the owner.
#
# The arm after a queued close is a handling successor
# (FM_WATCH_PREDECESSOR_ARM_PID, as bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh passes): the
# queued wake is already on its way, so that watcher does not resurface
# watcher downtime the primary has not drained yet.
#
# After three failed arms the supervisor queues one `check:` line and records
# the episode in state/.codex-idle-continuity-failure-notified. While that
# record stands no allowing stop starts a supervisor, so a watcher that stays
# broken wakes the thread once rather than once per turn. An actionable
# supervisor close or a successful bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh clears it.
