# fm-secondmate-wake-check.sh - does each recorded secondmate still CONSUME its
# own durable wake queue?
#
# Usage:
#   fm-secondmate-wake-check.sh scan [--startup]
#   fm-secondmate-wake-check.sh probe <secondmate-home>
#
# scan   Evaluate every LOCAL kind=secondmate direct report this home records,
#        queue one durable check wake per newly observed stall, and print an
#        "actionable: ..." line for each. At most one evaluation per
#        FM_SECONDMATE_WAKE_SCAN_SECS; --startup is the supported forced
#        evaluation and always runs. Silent and exit 0 when every recorded
#        secondmate is consuming its queue. A remote route, or a home this scan
#        cannot read, is passed over silently rather than judged - see the
#        windows below, and use `probe` to see the exact reason for one home.
# probe  Print one verdict for a single home, with no wake and no cadence:
#        "ok", "stalled <age-seconds> <oldest-sequence>", or "skipped <reason>".
#        Always exits 0; the verdict is the output.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT ASSERTS
#
# A secondmate is woken by its own watcher, its watcher is armed by its own
# session, and its session runs only when woken. Once that loop stops with a
# wake already queued, nothing inside that home can restart it, because waking
# is precisely what it lost. From outside, the fleet asked only whether an agent
# process existed - and an idle secondmate and a deaf one answer that question
# identically. This asserts the other half: that the home's durable wake queue
# is being consumed.
#
# The signal is the age of the OLDEST unacknowledged row in the secondmate's own
# state/.wake-queue. Each row carries its own append epoch inside the record,
# written once and never rewritten, and a row leaves the queue only through the
# generation-bound acknowledgement that follows handling. So this is positive
# evidence produced by the very mechanism that failed: something needed handling
# and handling did not consume it. An empty queue is a healthy idle mate; an old
# row is a deaf one. That is exactly the distinction the process check cannot
# make, and it is why the two rejected candidates are not used:
#
#   - A stale liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) is written only while a
#     watcher process runs. A healthy idle home legitimately has no watcher
#     between cycles, and a home that has never armed one has no beacon file at
#     all, so "stale" and "absent" are its normal steady state. Asserting on it
#     reproduces the idle/deaf confusion one level down.
#   - An uncleared state/.watcher-down marker is republished on every watcher
#     close AND every durable queue append, so its mtime tracks the last append
#     rather than the age of the outage, and pending:downtime is its ordinary
#     transient state between a watcher close and the next handling turn. Its
#     generation token carries a timestamp only as an opaque uniqueness
#     component, which docs/watcher-continuity.md deliberately does not promise
#     as a clock.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT
#
# It is an adjunct to paths that already run - the watcher's ordinary poll cycle
# and session start - not a daemon, a watcher, or a monitoring service of its
# own. It reads; it never writes into another home, never starts a process, and
# never arms a watcher anywhere. Cross-home arming stays forbidden precisely
# because bin/fm-watch-arm.sh is single-home by design. Recovery is firstmate's:
# nudging the secondmate through its own endpoint makes that secondmate's own
# session take a turn and arm its own watcher.
#
# WINDOWS THIS DOES NOT CLOSE
#
#   - It detects a wake loop that received work and did not consume it. A dead
#     wake loop in a home where nothing appends to the queue produces no row and
#     no finding.
#   - A remote secondmate's home lives on another machine, so its queue is not
#     locally readable at all. `scan` passes those routes over; it never claims
#     them healthy, but it does not cover them either, and nothing else does.
#   - Detection is bounded, not immediate: up to the stall bound plus one scan
#     interval. This turns a permanent outage into a delayed one.
#   - It proves the queue is not draining. It does not prove why.
#
# It also does not restart that home's own intake. A registered long-polling
# source is re-armed by its home's own `bin/fm-procevent.sh reconcile`, which
# runs from that home's watcher - the very thing that stopped - so a deaf home's
# intake stays down until its wake loop is restored. That is why the two halves
# are separate: `reconcile` recovers intake without waiting for a handler, and
# this recovers a home where `reconcile` is not running at all. Neither assumes
# the other.
#
# It takes no lock in the secondmate's home: acquiring another home's wake-queue
# lock would both write into that home and let a wedged foreign lock stall this
# scan. Reading unlocked is safe for this verdict because appends only ever add
# a row at the end, so a partially written newest row cannot change which row is
# oldest; malformed rows are ignored.
