# fm-account-pin-lib.sh - the single owner of account-pin mechanics: which
# runners require a pin, how a home's pin is resolved and validated, the
# spawn-time authentication preflight under that pin, and the environment
# credentials a pinned Claude launch sheds.
#
# docs/configuration.md "Account pins" owns the operator-facing contract and
# the reasons the other runners carry no pin. Sourced by bin/fm-spawn.sh,
# bin/fm-quota-snapshot.sh, and bin/fm-quota-choose.sh.
#
# Pinned runners, each a credential file inside a root its vendor lets a
# process select:
#   claude          CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR     config/claude-config-dir
#   pi, pi-signed   PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR   config/pi-agent-dir
#
# A Pi root can hold several ChatGPT logins at once, one per provider id, so
# the Pi pin selects the root and the model's provider selects the account
# inside it. config/pi-account-side is what keeps work and personal apart:
# fm_account_pin_side_guard refuses any Pi launch whose provider does not match
# the side the home declares, and refuses a launch whose provider it cannot
# read off the model at all, because the root's defaultProvider is a personal
# account on the shared root and must never decide a work launch.
#
# Resolution: both pins are home-local, never inherited, and name the accounts
# the home's workers use, so a worker or scout launch reads only the home's
# file: inside a secondmate the ambient CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is the supervisor's
# account. A secondmate is a supervisor and is resolved against the launching
# home instead, where a non-empty ambient CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR still wins for
# Claude. The root must be an absolute, existing, readable, searchable
# directory. A missing pin refuses; nothing falls back to ~/.claude or
# ~/.pi/agent.
#
# Preflight: the runner's own non-interactive check, run with only HOME, PATH,
# TMPDIR, and the pin in its environment, so a provider key left in the caller
# cannot answer for an empty root. Claude: `quota-axi auth --json --provider
# claude`; a source that is available, expired (renewed on next use), or
# skipped with a credential present passes. Pi: `pi auth check --provider
# <the launch model's provider> --json --no-refresh`, and only status "ready"
# passes. That command loads no extensions, so an extension-registered provider
# comes back not_ready/provider_not_found; only that one answer falls through to
# `pi --list-models <provider>`, which does load them, and the launch passes
# only when a listed row's provider and model columns both match exactly. Every
# other answer, including a logged-out built-in provider's
# not_ready/credentials_not_configured and no answer within the bound, refuses.
# --no-refresh keeps the check from rewriting a root's tokens while other
# workers use them. A codex-native/<id> model is not checked: that provider
# comes from the pi-codex-native extension and signs in through Codex's own
# login, which has no pin.
