# Read quota-axi under one candidate runner's account pin.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-quota-snapshot.sh <harness> [quota-axi args...]
#
# Dispatch intake reads capacity per account pin, never ambient
# (.agents/skills/quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md). For a pinned runner (claude,
# pi, pi-signed) this resolves the active home's pin exactly as bin/fm-spawn.sh
# does, refuses exactly as spawn refuses when it is missing or invalid, and
# runs quota-axi with that pin exported, so the rows quota-axi reads from that
# root describe the pinned account. Any other runner has no pin and runs
# quota-axi in the ambient environment. Arguments pass through unchanged, so
# one command serves the default TOON, the --json fallback, and `auth --json`.
#
# quota-axi reads a pin only where its README says it does: CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
# for the claude row, PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR for Pi's own pi:xai and
# pi:kimi-coding sources. docs/configuration.md "Account pins" owns what that
# means for a Pi candidate whose row comes from another store.
#
# Exit status: quota-axi's own; 1 when the pin refuses; 2 on a usage error.
