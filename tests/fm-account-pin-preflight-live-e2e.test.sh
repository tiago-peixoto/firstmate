# Default-on live guard for the spawn-time account-pin preflight
# (bin/fm-account-pin-lib.sh).
#
# The preflight's verdict comes from what two vendor checks emit: Pi's
# `pi auth check --json`, Pi's `--list-models`, and quota-axi's `auth --json`
# row for Claude. A fake can only repeat the answer written into it, so this
# runs the real tools against throwaway roots and checks the verdict each root
# must get:
#   - an empty Pi root refuses, and still refuses when the caller carries
#     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, which real Pi counts as a credential for any root;
#   - a Pi root holding an API-key credential in its auth.json passes;
#   - a Pi launch naming no provider refuses, because one root can hold several
#     accounts and the root's defaultProvider must not pick between them;
#   - a provider only an extension registers passes when the root serves its
#     models and refuses when it does not, which is the one case `pi auth check`
#     cannot answer for at all;
#   - an empty Claude root refuses;
#   - a Claude root holding an unexpired OAuth credentials file passes.
# Raw Pi is also asked under the caller's key, so the scrubbed case cannot pass
# vacuously if a Pi release stops reading that variable, and raw Pi's own
# provider_not_found answer is asserted so the extension case cannot pass
# through a path the library never takes.
#
# No credential is real and no prompt is submitted, so the shared live gate
# runs it by default wherever pi, quota-axi, and jq are installed. Run it after
# a Pi or quota-axi upgrade, and before refreshing
# docs/verification/dispatch-auth.md "Account-pin preflight".
