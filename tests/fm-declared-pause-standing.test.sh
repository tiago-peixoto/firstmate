# tests/fm-declared-pause-standing.test.sh - a declared external wait is a
# STANDING intent, not the status log's newest event.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. state/<id>.status is an append-only event log, and every
# pause gate used to read it last-event-wins. So a crew that appended
#   paused: waiting on the upstream maintainer
# kept its wedge-alarm suppression only until the NEXT line landed - from anyone.
# The crew's own armed background reporter, a pipeline step notice, a firstmate
# note: any of them became the newest event, current state flipped away from the
# declaration, the possible-wedge ladder restarted from zero, and nothing reported
# that the suppression had been voided. Measured independently twice in the live
# fleet: 73% of possible-wedge wakes named a crew that had ALREADY declared a
# wait, and one crew was escalated thirty times over four days while declaring,
# each time, that it was waiting on something external.
#
# bin/fm-classify-lib.sh's status_standing_wait_line is the fix, and its header
# owns the retraction rule and the reasoning behind it. This suite is that
# function's own contract, driven through the real library.
#
# THE RISK HERE RUNS THE WRONG WAY, so these cases defend both directions with
# equal weight. Erring noisy costs model requests; erring quiet means a genuinely
# wedged crew sits unnoticed, which is the exact failure the alarm exists to
# prevent. Every case that widens suppression is therefore paired with one that
# proves suppression did not widen further than intended.
#
# The rest of the contract lives with the surfaces that own it:
#   - tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh: what bin/fm-crew-state.sh reports under a
#     masked declaration, and that crew_absorb_class still reads `paused`.
#   - tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh: the watcher end to end - a masked pause
#     absorbed instead of wedge-escalated, still re-surfaced on its bounded
#     cadence, and an undeclared idle pane escalating exactly as before.
