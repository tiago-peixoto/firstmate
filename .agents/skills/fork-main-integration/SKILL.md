  Agent-only procedure for operating Firstmate from a permanent personal-fork main.
  Use before configuring or reversing Firstmate code remotes, briefing a Firstmate divergence topic, provisioning or using the isolated fork validation registration, integrating or discarding a divergence, responding to UPSTREAM_SYNC output or an upstream-integration required/failed result, preparing an upstream merge, re-justifying its conflicts, or deciding what the fork still carries.

# fork-main-integration

Load this procedure only when the Firstmate code repository itself uses permanent fork-main integration.
[`docs/fork-main.md`](../../../docs/fork-main.md) is the operator-current owner of the mechanics, the manifest schema, and the health criteria.
The script headers own exact mechanics and arguments.
This file keeps what binds you at the point of action - the prohibitions, the order of operations, and the judgements no report can make for you - and points at that owner for everything descriptive.

## Safety boundaries

- `origin` is the personal fork and `upstream` is official.
- Never migrate the captain's operating checkout as a side effect.
  Run `bin/fm-fork-remotes.sh plan`, show the reverse command, and obtain concrete captain confirmation before the live `apply` command.
- Never reconfigure the ordinary no-mistakes registration to target fork main.
- Normal live-home remote migration must prove that registration before and after the Git change.
  The `--no-registration` exception belongs only to provisioned remote code roots that never validate changes, and is never a retry or bypass after a registration error.
- Provision a separate private integration clone only through `bin/fm-fork-integration.sh`.
  Stop if ordinary-registration isolation cannot be proven before and after init.
- Never restart or update the shared no-mistakes service from this workflow.
- Live homes remain fast-forward-only consumers of validated fork main.
  Real upstream and topic merges happen only in isolated candidates.
- Keep `rerere.autoupdate=false`.
  A replayed resolution must remain unstaged and reviewable.
- Never force-push or rewrite a published topic or pull-request branch.
- Never habitually merge upstream or fork main into a divergence topic.
  Do so only for a concrete API dependency, a real merge conflict, or an upstream maintainer request.
- Every fork-main PR still requires the captain's explicit merge approval.

## New divergence intake

1. Scaffold the Firstmate ship brief with `--start-ref upstream/main` so unrelated fork divergences cannot enter the upstream pull request.
   That generated brief loads this procedure for the worker and directly carries the no-rewrite, no-routine-merge, and official-upstream validation rules through the typed launch input.
2. Run the ordinary no-mistakes path against the official-upstream registration.
3. Preserve the upstream pull request as the delivery and review artifact.
4. Before fork integration, ensure the canonical `fm/divergence/<id>` topic contains one aggregate non-merge patch commit relative to upstream.
   `git cherry` is patch-by-patch and cannot prove that a multi-commit topic equals one upstream squash commit.
5. Never rewrite a published multi-commit PR branch to satisfy step 4.
   Create a fresh one-commit canonical divergence topic and retain the original head as the manifest-linked delivery artifact.
6. Create an isolated candidate from fetched fork main in the private integration clone.
7. Run `bin/fm-fork-topic.sh integrate` with a concrete retirement condition and complete path list.
   On exit 3, settle the retain decision, resolve and stage the product conflict, and run receipt-bound `bin/fm-fork-topic.sh continue` with the complete decision file.
8. Drive no-mistakes from that integration clone, run health against the post-pipeline head, open the fork-main PR, and require fork CI green.
9. Tell the captain the full fork PR URL and concise local outcome.
10. Merge only after the captain says so, using the regular merge method so the inner topic merge remains reachable.
11. Run `/updatefirstmate` after landing so safe homes fast-forward from validated fork main.

A vague retirement reminder is not a valid manifest condition.
Use a falsifiable statement such as "Upstream ships equivalent endpoint identity validation" or "This compatibility path is no longer reachable on every supported backend".

## Upstream review disposition

A pending divergence whose PR closes without merge must not remain pending.
Choose one of two outcomes in the next validated fork integration:

- Reclassify it to `rejected-but-retained` through `bin/fm-fork-topic.sh disposition` because current evidence still justifies the behavior.
- Discard it because its retirement condition is true or the evidence no longer supports carrying it.

Upstream rejection does not automatically remove useful running behavior.
A correctness or security finding that applies locally is stronger evidence than the earlier green run and requires an immediate fix or discard.

## Upstream integration

Handle `UPSTREAM_SYNC: required` or `upstream-integration: required` as work for the main primary, never a secondmate or remote code root.
Coalesce duplicate notifications behind one open integration task.

`UPSTREAM_SYNC: fork topology is not validated: <requirement>` is a different problem and never starts a merge.
This home has an `upstream` remote but has not completed the explicit migration, so the upstream movement probe was skipped and the line repeats on every startup until it is fixed.
Report the named requirement to the captain and, once they confirm, complete the migration through `plan` then the live `apply` command, or reverse it - never migrate `origin` silently to clear the line.

1. Ensure the private fork registration passes `bin/fm-fork-integration.sh check`.
2. Create an isolated candidate branch at fetched `origin/main` from the private integration clone.
3. Run `bin/fm-fork-merge.sh prepare`.
4. On a clean result, inspect the emitted `git range-diff --remerge-diff` review and health result before starting no-mistakes.
5. On exit 3, treat every named conflict as a divergence re-justification decision before resolving files.
6. Load `ask-user-authority` before deciding whether routine authority can answer a re-justification.
   A material behavior expansion, destructive choice, security-sensitive choice, or captain-owned product trade-off still goes to the captain.
7. Resolve files only after the decision is settled, write the complete `firstmate.fork-rejustify.v1` decision file outside the candidate working tree, and run `continue`.
   If the settled decision is complete removal, use the receipt-bound upstream `abort`, then the independent topic `discard` path, land that candidate, and retry upstream preparation instead of continuing the conflict.
8. Drive no-mistakes through the private fork registration and process every gate.
9. Require fork CI green and captain merge approval.
10. Use the regular merge method, then run `/updatefirstmate`.

A replayed rerere result supplies only the previously accepted file resolution, never the answer to whether the divergence is still worth carrying; the unmerged index is the barrier that keeps that decision explicit, so never let a replay stand in for it.

## Health and relevance

Use `bin/fm-fork-status.sh` for the local answer and add `--refresh` only when live remote and PR evidence is needed.
After no-mistakes, use the post-pipeline candidate command in [`docs/fork-main.md`](../../../docs/fork-main.md); a bare invocation reads the fork remote rather than proving candidate `HEAD`.
Its own errors, signals, and exit status are the machine verdict, and [`docs/fork-main.md`](../../../docs/fork-main.md) states how it classifies raw `git cherry` facts and what makes it unhealthy.

Never describe the fork as healthy when that report is not.
The one judgement the report cannot make is yours: a pending unit that is aging without action is not a healthy fork, however clean the machine verdict.

Run the `git range-diff --remerge-diff` command the report prints for every unit the latest upstream merge touched.
It is a human review surface, not machine state.

## Discard

Prepare discard only from an isolated branch at fetched fork main:

```sh
bin/fm-fork-topic.sh discard --id <id> --repo <isolated-worktree>
```

Any product-file conflict reopens re-justification and leaves a receipt-bound merge or revert operation.
Resolve the decision and files, write the complete `firstmate.fork-rejustify.v1` decision outside the candidate, then run `bin/fm-fork-topic.sh continue --decisions <file> --repo <isolated-worktree>`.
Validate the actual post-pipeline candidate through the private fork registration and require captain approval for its fork-main PR.
Never reset or rewrite fork main to remove a divergence.

Git remembers a reverted merge as unwanted ancestry.
To restore discarded behavior, revert the revert or introduce a genuinely new topic version.
Do not merge the old topic blindly.
